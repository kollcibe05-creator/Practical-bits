# Welcome to my test files!!

You will probably get most of the code in jumbles but that's okay. It is a clear indication that I i have done extensive work to own the skill by coding and that I deserve to be where I am.
It serves as a souvenir in my coding journey and my biggest dream is that I will one day revert to them and sigh citing "Yeah! We did it man"
